## The Khalistan Constitution Project
An Open Source Project To Develop A Constitution For A Country Called Khalistan.

***


## Introduction
This is an open source project to develop a model constitution for a country to be called Khalistan.
## Contributing To The Constitution
Since this an open source project, anyone can contribute to this project. Our objective is to draw upon the wealth of constitutional and other expertise that is available world-wide. 

Since the creation of the United Nations over thirty countries have been formed through a referendum process. This country creation process is bound to increase in the future as the devolution of rights and control devolves downwards to people at large. By creating an open source constitution for Khalistan, it is our hope that this constitution can also serve as a reference point for all of the new countries that will emerge in the future.
## What Is In It For Me?
 If you make a pull request that is accepted into the master branch of the constitution as an article of the constitution or a substantial addition or modification of an existing article, then you will be entitled as a constitutional provision to automatic citizenship in Khalistan irrespective of caste, color or creed.
 
## Legal Basis For Creating A Country
 
 The articles of the United Nations provides that a referendum is a laful way to create a country, providing that the referendum expresses the will of the people. As a member of the United Nations, India has agreed to this provision, which is a condition for membership in the UN.
