## The Khalistan Constitution Project
An Open Source Project To Develop A Constitution For A Country Called Khalistan.

***


## Introduction
This is an open source project to develop a model constitution for a country to be called Khalistan.

## Contributing To The Constitution

Since this an open source project, anyone can contribute to this project. Our objective is to draw upon the wealth of constitutional, legal, academic and other expertise that is available world-wide.

Since the creation of the United Nations in 1945 over thirty countries have been formed through a referendum process. This referendum based country creation process is bound to increase in importance in the future as the devolution of political and social rights devolves downwards to people at large. By creating an open source constitution for Khalistan, it is our hope that this constitution will also serve as a model and reference point for all of the new countries that will emerge in the future.

It does not cost anything to participate in this project. The wiki provides you with information on how to do this:

## What Is In It For You?

If you make a pull request that is accepted into the master branch of the constitution as an article of the constitution or as a substantial addition or modification of an existing article, then you will be entitled as a constitutional right to automatic citizenship in Khalistan irrespective of caste, color or creed.


 
## Legal Basis For Creating A Country
 
The articles of the United Nations provide that a referendum is a lawful way to create a country, providing that the referendum expresses the will of the people. As a member of the United Nations, India has agreed to this provision, which is a condition for it's membership in the UN.

The principle of self-determination is prominently embodied in **Article 1 of the Charter Of The United Nations**. It is also posiitioned as the first right  in the **International Covenant Of Civil And Political Rights (ICCPR)** and the **International Covenant On Economic, Social And Cultural Rights (ICECR)**. 

At present, a worldwide campaign for a referendum on Khalistan is underway. There is a significant Sikh diaspora. The first portion of this campaign entails voter registration. There is significant extra-judicial and state sanctioned violent opposition to this referendum from the Government of India.
 
## So What Is Khalistan Anyways?

Khalistan is the traditional homeland of the Sikhs and people who speak the Punjabi language and are aboriginal inhabitants of the land for at least four generations (**The Punjabis**). Khalistan is the portion of northern India where the Punjabi language and culture have been traditionally dominant. 

The country of Khalistan will be a buffer state physically seperating three hostile and belligerant nuclear armed states: India, China and Pakistan.

The Punjabis and The Sikhs are a people with the following distinguishing features:

- Punjabis, have resided in the Punjab region of Northern India since at least 2,000 B.C.
- Punjabi is the 10th most prevalent language in the world.
- Sikhism is the fifth largest religion in the world. Sikhism is the dominant religion in the Punjab.
- Punjabis have their own distinct language and script.
- Punjabis have a distinctive culture and customs.
- Sikhs are easily recognizable due to their unique appearance.
- There are 30 million Sikhs in India and 5 to 7 million Sikhs living outside India.


## A Short History Of Khalistan

Sikhs have ruled over portions of the Punjab region since at least 1675. 

On 15 June 1606, Guru Hargobind constructed the Akal Takht (** Throne Of God ** ). This Throne was (physically) higher than the throne of the Mughal Empire. Guru Hargobind then ascended onto this throne wearing ** the swords Miri and Piri **. Miri representing sovereignty in the material world and Piri represetng sovereignty in the spiritual domain. The throne and the act of sitting on it constituted an act of treason against the empire and signalled the start of Sikh resistance to the Moghul Empire.

On April 13, 1699, Guru Gobind Singh established the Khalsa as an armed Sikh Militia at large, constituted of every Sikh irrespective of gender (**Khalsa Akal Purukh Ki Fauj, Pargateo Khalsa Parmatam Ki Mauj**). Every Sikh was required to be armed. 

### Sikh Nation Established

In 1708, Guru Gobind Singh started on a journey to parley with the Mughul Emperor in the Deccan (on the latter's invitation). While in the jungles of Nandehr, the Guru met a reclusive hermit named Lachman Das. The Guru baptized Lachman Das into the Sikh faith and gave him the name **Banda Bahadur**. The Guru then provided the hermit with five arrows from his scabbard and five Sikhs and instructed him to travel nearly 800 miles northward to The Punjab to confront the Empire and establish Sikh Rule. Guru Gobind Singh was assasinated a short time thereafter and the Moghul Emperer also passed away. 

Banda Bahadur established a  Sikh Nation as a commonwealth (there was no King) and coinage struck. This nation lasted from 1709 to 1715. In 1715, Banda Bahadur and his army were captured after a nine month siege.  Banda Bahadur and his infant son were tortured to death in public (* European eye witness accounts are available.*) and many Sikhs were summarily executed.

As the Sikh resistance against the Mughal Empire gained ground and the Mughal persecution of the Sikhs intensified, the entire Sikh nation was divided into two standing armies: **The Army of The Elders**  (Budha Dal) and the **Army Of The Young** (Taruna Dal).
 
These two standing armies constituting the entire Sikh nation devolved in time into heavily armed militias called **Misls**. From 1720 to 1790, the Sikh Misls confronted the Mughal Empire and the Sikhs ruled portions of the Punjab intermittently during this period.

### The First Extermination

In 1739, the Mughal Empire passed a decree ordering Sikhs to be killed wherever they could be found in the Empire. Rewards were offered to the general public for killing Sikhs and bringing in their heads (recognizable by the long mane). The property of Sikhs was confisticated.

In 1741, two Sikhs Bota Singh and Garja Singh blocked a major highway near Taran Taaran in the Moghul Empire and demanded a toll to be paid before letting anyone cross into sovereign Sikh territory. The Empire dispatched a column of soldiers who killed them.

The first extermination lasted from 1739 to 1746.

### The Second Extermination

A second extermnination of the Sikhs began in 1756 and lasted until 1762. The extermination process was eventually crushed by the Sikh Misls and Nawab Kapoor Singh in particular. 

(* Mythology? *): The exterminations had reduced the Sikh Nation to about fifty to sixty thousand individuals living in the jungles of the Punjab. Then at a non-descript place in District Ropar in the Punjab in 1778, the tide turned. There was a small skirmish between The Sikhs and a column of soldiers of the Mughul Empire. Thereafter The Sikhs would not lose a battle until they confronted the English army some seventy five years later.

### A Boy Comes Onto The Scene

In 1791 a young boy named Ranjit Singh, hideously disfigured by smallpox and blind in one eye emerged to lead the Sukerchakia Misl, fighting his first battle at the age of 12. He told his mother: *"don't fret mother, I will establish Sikh Rule"*.

By 1799, the Sikh Misls having defeated the Mughal Empire, united under Ranjit Singh to form the Sikh Empire. It's name was **Sarkar-E-Khalsa-Jio** (**The Government Of The Khalsa, Beloved**). At its zenith, the empire included most of Northern India, Pakistan, Kashmir, Ladakh, Tibet and portions of Afganistan. Sarkar-E-Khalsa Jio was not strictly an autocracy. It had remarkable characteristics with very advanced notions of social justice and political organization. This was an articulation of principles enunciated in the Sikh religion.

By 1812 the British Empire had reached Delhi which was the southern border of the Sikh Empire. Since the Sikh Empire had a fearsome army with French and German Generals,  the British decided to bide their time waiting for the Sikh Empire to grow weak. In 1812 the Sikhs cast the biggest cannon in the world. 

### Anglo-Sikh Wars

In 1845 the Sikh Emperor died and the first Anglo-Sikh war between the Sikhs and the British Empire broke out and the Sikhs defeated the English army. This war lasted from 1845 to 1846.

In 1848 a brutal civil war broke out challenging the right of the **Empress Jind Kaur** to head the Sikh Empire. It was a palace plot hatched by treacherous Hindu high caste Dogra courtiers and the English. The British then approached Jind Kaur promising to safe guard her eldest son Duleep Singh until she quelled the on-going civil war. 

Having secured the custody of the heir apparent to Ranjit Singh, the English attacked the Sikh Empire and the second Anglo-Sikh war started in 1848. At the last battle at Sabraon in 1849 (now in Pakistan). 90,000 Sikhs faced a 110,000 strong English army. The Sikhs lost the battle and their empire. Sardar Sham Singh Attari, aged over seventy years was leading the Sikhs, he had sworn to not come back from the battle alive if the Sikhs lost at Sabroan. He died on the battlefield. His wife who was in her castle some three hundred miles away, heard persistent rumors that the Sikhs had lost the battle. She threw herself on her own funeral pyre. The English impressed by the bravery of **General Sham Singh Attari**, permitted his personal retainer to take the body of the slain general back to his home for a proper funeral. The retainer arrived a few days later to find that Sham Singh Attari's wife had thrown herself on her own funeral pyre. The treacherous Hindu Dogras proceeded to exterminate Empress Jind Kaur's bloodline. Three year old Prince Kharak Singh was killed by smashing his head in with a large stone. 

**Prince Duleep Singh** was taken to England and converted into a Christian. He never returned to the Punjab. Empress Jind Kaur was taken to Burma (now Myanmaar) and kept imprisoned in Rangoon for the rest of her natural life.

And it was in this manner that the Sikh Empire was lost.

### Betrayal And Annexation Of The Sikh Nation

In 1948, India gained independence and the Punjab was absorbed into the newly formed state. The Sikhs refused to sign onto the constitution and the Punjab was annexed into India on the basis of false promises and constitutional guarantees that were never implemented. The Sikhs constituted 38 per cent of the British India Army and made the fatal mistake of not wresting control of Khalistan by force of arms.

There has been continuous unrest and agitation in the Punjab since 1948. The constitution of India refused to recognize Sikhism as a seperate religion and the Sikhs as a seperate people. In 1952 legislation was passed declaring Sikhs to be a **criminal tribe**.

In 1984, the Government of India launched a **well planned genocide** which resulted in the mass murder of 200,000 to 300,000 Sikhs. India has never permitted an independent, international investigation of this genocide. At present an ethnic cleansing campaign is underway in the Punjab targeting the Sikh religion and culture. The ultimate objective is to destroy the Sikh religion and culture and render Sikhs a small minority in their traditional homeland as the area is flooded by 'foreign' Indian people who speak a different language and have a different religion and customs. The same fate has been ordained for Kashmir.
