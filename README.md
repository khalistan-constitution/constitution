## The Khalistan Constitution Project
An Open Source Project To Develop A Constitution For A Country Called Khalistan.

***


## Introduction
This is an open source project to develop a model constitution for a country to be called Khalistan.

## Contributing To The Constitution
Since this an open source project, anyone can contribute to this project. Our objective is to draw upon the wealth of constitutional, legal, academic and other expertise that is available world-wide. 

Since the creation of the United Nations in 1945 over thirty countries have been formed through a referendum process. This referendum based country creation process is bound to increase in importance in the future as the devolution of political and social right devolves downwards to people at large. By creating an open source constitution for Khalistan, it is our hope that this constitution will also serve as a model for all of the new countries that will emerge in the future.

## What Is In It For You?
 If you make a pull request that is accepted into the master branch of the constitution as an article of the constitution or as a substantial addition or modification of an existing article, then you will be entitled as a constitutional right to automatic citizenship in Khalistan irrespective of caste, color or creed.
 
## Legal Basis For Creating A Country
 
The articles of the United Nations provide that a referendum is a lawful way to create a country, providing that the referendum expresses the will of the people. As a member of the United Nations, India has agreed to this provision, which is a condition for it's membership in the UN.
 
 At present, a worldwide campaign for a referendum on Khalistan is underway. There is a significant Sikh diaspora.  The first portion of this campaign entails voter registration. There is significant extra-judicial and state sanctioned violent opposition to this referendum from the Government of India.
 
## So What Is Khalistan Anyways?
 Khalistan is the traditional homeland of the Sikhs and people who speak the Punjabi language (*The Punjabis*).  Khalistan is the portion of northern India where the Punjabi language and culture are dominant. Khalistan will be a buffer state physically seperating three belligerant nuclear armed states, India, China and Pakistan.
 
 The Punjabis and The Sikhs are a people with the following distinguishing features:
 
- Punjabis, have resided in the Punjab region of Northern India since at least 2,000 B.C.
- Punjabi is the 10th most prevalent language in the world.
- Sikhism is the fifth largest religion in the world. Sikhism is the dominant religion in the Punjab.
- Punjabis have their own distinct language and script.
- Punjabis have a distinctive culture and customs. 
- Sikhs are easily recognizable due to their unique appearance.
- There are 30 million Sikhs in India and 5 to 7 million Sikhs living outside India.


## A Short History Of Khalistan

Sikhs have ruled over portions of the Punjab region since at least 1675. On April 13, 1699, Guru Gobind Singh established the Khalsa as an armed Sikh Militia at large, constituted of every Sikh irrespective of gender (*Khalsa Akal Purukh Ki Fauj, Pargateo Khalsa Parmatam Ki Mauj*). Every Sikh was required to be armed. As the Sikh resistance against the Mughal Empire gained ground  and the Mughal persecution of the Sikhs intensified, the entire Sikh nation was divided into two standing armies: The Army of The Elders (*Budha Dal*) and the Army Of The Young (*Taruna Dal*) 

These two standing armies constituting the entire Sikh nation  devolved in time into heavily armed militias called *misls*. From 1699 to 1775, the Sikh Misls confronted the Mughal Empire and the Sikhs ruled portions of the Punjab intermittently during this period. 

In 1735 and again 1758, the Mughal Empire passed laws to exterminate ag gll Sikhs whereever they could be found. The general population were given substantial reward for every Sikh head brought in (recognizable by the long unshorn hair of males and females). The extermination process was eventually crushed by the Sikh Misls and Nawab Kapoor Singh.  

By 1770 a young boy named Ranjit Singh emerged to lead the Sukerchakia Misl, fighting his first battle at the age of 12. 

By 1780, the Sikh Misls having defeated the Mughal Empire,  united under Ranjit Singh to form the Sikh Empire. This empire included most of Northern India, Pakistan, Kashmir, Ladakh, Tibet and portions of Afganistan. This Empire had remarkable characteristics with very advanced notions of social justice and political organization. This was an ariculation of the Sikh religion.

By 1812 the British Empire had reached Delhi which was the southern border of the Sikh Empire. Since the Sikh Empire had a fearsome army with French and German Generals, the British decided to bide their time waiting for the Sikh Empire to grow weak. In 1846 the Sikh Emperor died  the first war between the Sikhs and the English Empire broke out and the Sikhs defeated the English army.  In 1848 a brutal civil war broke out challenging the right of the Empress Jind Kaur to head the Sikh Empire. It was a palace plot hatched by Hindu Dogra courtiers and the English. The British then approached Jind Kaur promising to safe guard her eldest son Duleep Singh until she quelled the on-going civil war. The English then attacked the Sikh Empire and the second Anglo-Sikh war ensued. At the last battle at Sabroan (now in Pakistan) 90,000 Sikhs faced a 110,000 strong English army. The Sikhs lost the battle and their empire. the Sikhs lost their empire. General Sardar Sham Singh Attari, aged over seventy years,  had sworn to not come back from the alive if the Sikhs lost. He died on the battlefield. His wife who was in her castle some three hundred miles away,  heard rumors that the Sikhs had lost the battle. She threw herself on her own funeral pyre. The English impressed by the bravery of General Sham Singh Attari, permitted his personal retainer to take the body of the slain general back to his home for a proper funeral. The retainer arrived a few days later to find that Sham Singh Attari's wife had killed herself. The treacherous Hindu Dogras proceeded to exterminate Empress  Jind Kaur's bloodline. Three year old Prince Kharak Singh was killed by smashing his head in with a large stone. Prince Duleep Singh was taken to England and converted into a Christian. Empress Jind Kaur was taken to Burma (now Myanmaar) for the rest of her natural life.

And it was in this manner that the very great and wonderous Sikh Empire was lost.

In 1948, India gained independence and the Punjab was absorbed into the newly formed state. The Sikhs refused to sign onto the constitution and the Punjab was annexed into India on the basis of false promises and constitutional guarantees that were never implemented. 

There has been continuous unrest and agitation in the Punjab since 1948. The constitution of India refused to recognize Sikhism as a seperate religion and the Sikhs as a seperate people. In 1952 legislation was passed declaring Sikhs to be a criminal tribe.

 In 1984,  the Government of India launched a *well planned* genocide which resulted in the mass murder of 200,000 to 300,000 Sikhs. India has never permitted an independent, international investigation of this genocide. At present an ethnic cleansing campaign is underway in the Punjab targeting the Sikh religion and culture.
