## The Khalistan Constitution Project
An Open Source Project To Develop A Constitution For A Country Called Khalistan.

***


## Introduction
This is an open source project to develop a model constitution for a country to be called Khalistan.
## Contributing To The Constitution
Since this an open source project, anyone can contribute to this project. Our objective is to draw upon the wealth of constitutional and other expertise that is available world-wide. 

Since the creation of the United Nations in 1945 over thirty countries have been formed through a referendum process. This country creation process is bound to increase in the future as the devolution of rights and political control devolves downwards to people at large. By creating an open source constitution for Khalistan, it is our hope that this constitution can also serve as a reference point for all of the new countries that will emerge in the future.

## What Is In It For Me?
 If you make a pull request that is accepted into the master branch of the constitution as an article of the constitution or as a substantial addition or modification of an existing article, then you will be entitled as a constitutional right to automatic citizenship in Khalistan irrespective of caste, color or creed.
 
## Legal Basis For Creating A Country
 
 The articles of the United Nations provides that a referendum is a lawful way to create a country, providing that the referendum expresses the will of the people. As a member of the United Nations, India has agreed to this provision, which is a condition for membership in the UN.
 
 At present, a worldwide campaign for a referendum on Khalistan is underway. There is a significant Sikh diaspora.  Phase 1 of this campaign entails voter registration. There is significant extra-judicial and state sanctioned violent opposition to this referendum from the Government of India.
 
## So What Is Khalistan Anyways?
 Khalistan is the traditional homeland of the Sikhs and people who speak the Punjabi language (*The Punjabis*).  Khalistan is the portion of northern India where the Punjabi language and culture are dominant. Khalistan will be a buffer state physically seperating three belligerant nuclear armed states, India, China and Pakistan.
 
 The Punjabis and Sikhs are a people with the following distinguishing features:
 
- Punjabis, have resided in the Punjab region of Northern India since at least 2000 B.C.
- Punjabi is the 10th most prevalent language in the world.
- Sikhism is the fifth largest religion in the world. Sikhism is the dominant religion in the Punjab.
- Punjabis have their own distinct language and script.
- Punjabis have a distinctive culture and cusoms. 
- Sikhs are easily recognizable due to their unique appearance.
- There are 30 million Sikhs in India and 5 to 7 million Sikhs living outside India.


## A Short History Of Khalistan

Sikhs have ruled over portions of the Punjab region since at least 1675. On April 13, 1699, Guru Gobind Singh established the Khalsa as an armed Sikh Militia at large, constituted of every Sikh irrespective of gender (*Khalsa Akal Purukh Ki Fauj, Pargateo Khalsa Parmatam Ki Mauj*). Every Sikh was required to be armed. This armed citizen's militia at large devolved in time into heavily armed militias called *misls* From 1699 to 1775, the Sikh Misls confronted the Mughal Empire and the Sikhs ruled portions of the Punjab intermittently during this period. 

By 1780, the Sikh Misls having defeated the Mughal Empire,  united to form the Sikh Empire. This empire included most of Northern India, Pakistan, Kashmir, Ladakh, Tibet and portions of Afganistan. This Empire had remarkable characteristics with very advanced notions of social justice and political organization. This was an ariculation of the Sikh religion.

By 1812 the British Empire had reached the southern border of the Sikh Empire. Since the Sikh Empire had a fearsome army, the British then waited for the Sikh Empire to grow weak. In 1846 the Sikh Emperor died  the first war between the Sikhs and the English Empire broke out and the Sikhs defeated the English army.  In 1848, the second Anglo-Sikh war broke out and the Sikhs lost their empire and the Punjab was absorbed into the British Empire. The loss was due to internal betrayal by Hindu Dogras.

In 1948, India gained independence and the Punjab was absorbed into the newly formed state. The Sikhs refused to sign onto the constitution and the Punjab was annexed into India on the basis of false promises and constitutional guarantees that were never implemented. 

There has been continuous unrest and agitation in the Punjab since 1948. The constitution of India refused to recognize Sikhism as a seperate religion and in 1952 legislation was passed declaring Sikhs to be a criminal tribe.

 In 1984,  the Government of India launched a *well planned* genocide which resulted in the mass murder of 200,000 to 300,000 Sikhs. India has never permitted an independent, international investigation of this genocide. At present an ethnic cleansing campaign is underway in the Punjab targeting the Sikh religion and culture.
